# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application that design,develop,test,deploy and maintenanceof quality systems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
in 2000 rise of agile methodologies
Advent of structured programming in 1970
1960there was establishment of software engeenering

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements this is gathering all information of user needs and documenting
Design it is creating solution including users interface and overall system
Implemantation this is coding according to design specification
Testing it involves various tests to make sure software is of high quality and functions
Deployment this is releasing the product to users
Maintenance this is taking care of software by checking on updates


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is whole initial process involved in developing while agile methodology is way on how process is flexible and allows collaboration

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer writes the code to create solutions
Quality Assurance designs ,ensure quality and tests
Project manager checks planning, executin and deliverable on projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments is a software that provides writing codes,debugging and testing eg VisualStudio
Version Control System tracts changes of codes and help in team works eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
tight deadlines the pressure to deliver a project. This can be solved by both parties communicating and planning well
Changing requirements this can be done through sprints where every one explain their stand, communication and knowing priorities

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing indicidual modules of a software
Integration testing means testing interactions between differnt components
Systems testing is testing the whole software system
Acceptance testing is testing software againist user requirements to meet user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting right question and give right instructions in a way that helps get best response from AI.
It gives clear,specific and complete of what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about flower. tell me about a flower that is wild, from northwest African and has glossy look. it is effective because it narrows down to a specific flower with such qualities
